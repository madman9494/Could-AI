## Inspiration
Are you tired of your old NFTs but not really into selling them? What about modifying them with our tool?  

## What it does
We made a protocol to modify existing NFTs with the help of neural networks using different filters (adding animation and movements, changing style, background, and many others)

## How we built it
We developed the smart contract that uses the create2 mechanism that provides the technology to allow one NFT to own another. As well we trained a neural network to perform animation transfer of motion from source NFT to another NFT. Later other types of neural networks transformation types can be added and applied

## Challenges we ran into
It was quite challenging to run a virtual machine with GPU to perform neural network inference. As well we faced some difficulties with the frontend part (deployment and interaction with a smart contract) 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We succeeded in training a neural network to generate good-quality gifs and created some funny NFTs. 

## What we learned
How to work with Polygon
How to mint NFT tokens
How to create proxy-contract
How to train and deploy neural networks
How to run GPU virtual machine
How to use Flask

## What's next for DO[NFT] - Dynamic Ownable NFT Collection
We will try to release our project in mainnet Polygon and start to attract NFT creators
